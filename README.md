# 8-puzzle solution using A* algorithm
#Task : Given a 3Ã—3 board with 8 tiles (every tile has one number from 1 to 8) and one empty space. The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match final configuration using the empty space. We can slide four adjacent (left, right, above and below) tiles into the empty space.

Heuristic function: number of cells that are not in their correct position
